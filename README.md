# Classification-of-Online-Banking
This project was made to classify account holders at a bank in regards to whether or not they will elect to use online banking. I used K Nearest Neighbors,
Decision Trees and Random Forests to accomplish this. I also used Bagging, Cross Validation, and feature importance.  Included in this repository is the raw code as well as a fully formatted report detailing our methodology and findings.
